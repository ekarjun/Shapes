============

Steps for an intial on-boarding:

# Decide on a working area and create a dir for it. This can be your home, as we are going to create
  a subdir in it. We will assume below it is your home (~).

# Have access to running orchestrator, obtain git URL and add your public ssh key to Asset Manager.

# Clone the master repo of the orchestrator's model-defintion:

  cd ~
  git clone <git url> orchestrate-model
  cd orchestrate-model

# Copy the sample tosca file from the examples dir into the tosca model directory:

  cp examples/simple-service-example/simple-service-example.tosca types/tosca/
  git add types/tosca/*

# Copy the sample ui schema to its place:

  cp examples/simple-service-example/examples.resourceTypes.SimpleServiceExample.json ui-schema/
  git add ui-schema/*

# Commit, push changes back to the orchestrator.

  git commit -am "First version of simple service example"
  git push

# Issue a pull request from the UI and verify that it has been accepted. If not, the issue raised by
  the orchestrator need to be addressed by further modifying the tosca file(s). Once it is accepted,
  the type and templates are ready to be used (see remaining steps).

# Create a new product for (each) service template you created. The above example creates exactly one
  template. Use the UI to auto-create a new product for each template that does not yet have at least
  one product.

# You should be ready to instantiate the given product from the orchestrator and see the form pop up
  as defined by the UI file.
